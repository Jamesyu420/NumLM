# SolveLM

This is a ongoing training package for numerical resolution of solving linear model by Baichen Yu. Some main ideas are below.

## QR factorization
Using linear algebra to solve a complex computational problem.

## Gradient descent
The most popular optimization algorithm in machine learning.

## Online learning

In this part, we suppose a simple model has been generated and we update the model for each one new observation.
