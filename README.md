# SolveLM

This is a ongoing training package for numerical resolution of solving linear model by Baichen Yu. Some main ideas are below.

## QR factorization
Using linear algebra to solve a complex computational problem.

## Gradient descent
The most popular optimization algorithm in machine learning.

## Online learning
In this part, we suppose a simple model has been generated and we update the model for each one new observation.

## Linear mixed model
Besides, we also introduce Linear mixed model solved by EM algorithm. Admittedly, it could be also solved by variational inference faster, but it is out of scope of this package. We here use a real genomic data to illustrate the algorithms and also check the correctness of our implements in the demo.
